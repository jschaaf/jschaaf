<h1>Hello, I’m Johnathan Schaaf</h1>
<p>That introduciton gave me serious Johnny Cash vibes, <em>lol</em>.</p>
<h2>Professional</h2> 
<p>I’ve been in <strong>graphic design/art direction</strong> for nearly 20 years. Just made the full transition to <strong>UI/UX design</strong> recently.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>I’m currently learning <strong>HTML, CSS, and Javascript (front-end development)</strong>, to better colaborate with the developers on my team, and to increase my own skillset. <em>Please don't laugh</em>, but I'm still trying to figure out what GitHub is all about, and what it's mainly used for ;).</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>My 3 main side hobbies are <strong>guitar, art/drawing, and skateboarding</strong>. Probably in that order.
